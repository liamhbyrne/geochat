## Inspiration
Recent events have emphasised a diminishing feeling of community that existed even before lockdown. We were surprised at the ease to make a connected the other side of the world but the distinct inability to build genuine connection within a local community.
## What it does
It uses location to provide group-chats of your closest location, allowing for the organisation of local events, advertising for local business, and being able to ask for recommendations etc...
## How we built it
We used android studio to make it into an android app, with Google Firebase as the back-end, taking care of database issues. We consulted our friends at university the full length of the project about what features they would like to see.
## Challenges we ran into
This was our first team programming task so we had lots of issues with branching and merging on git. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Managed to build a functional and aesthetic app in a weekend! The app achieved the goals we set out, and provides a unique take on social media.
## What we learned
How to use (and the importance of) Git. 
How to use Android studio and Firebase.
Architecture for NoSQL serverless apps.
What reverse geocoding is.
## What's next for GeoChat
Global domination baby.
